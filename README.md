# Expense Analysis

## Overview

The Expense Analysis project is a Python-based application that utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) to help users efficiently track and analyze their day-to-day expenses. This project is designed to simplify the process of recording expenses, providing valuable insights into financial habits. It offers several data visualization features, including monthly analysis, per-month total expense comparison, previous month expense monitoring, and previous month's item-based comparison.


## Features

- **Monthly Analysis**: Users can view a detailed breakdown of their expenses on a monthly basis. This feature allows them to gain insights into how much they spend each month and identify spending patterns.

- **Per Month Total Expense Comparison**: The project offers a comparative view of total expenses for different months. Users can compare their expenses across multiple months to track their financial progress.

- **Previous Month Expense Monitoring**: This feature provides a quick overview of expenses in the previous month. It helps users stay updated on their recent spending habits.

- **Previous Months All Item-Based Comparison**: Users can delve into a more detailed analysis by comparing expenses for specific items across different months. This allows for a thorough examination of spending on individual categories or items.

- **Detailed Analysis**: In addition to the above features, users can generate a comprehensive analysis, including graphs and charts, to visualize their financial data effectively.
